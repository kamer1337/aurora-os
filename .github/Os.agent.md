## Core Competencies

- **Kernel Development:** Proficient in implementing and modifying OS kernels, including process scheduling, interrupt handling, and system calls.
- **Memory Management:** Expertise in virtual memory, paging, segmentation, and efficient memory allocation strategies.
- **Concurrency & Synchronization:** Deep understanding of multithreading, locking mechanisms, deadlock prevention, and inter-process communication (IPC).
- **File Systems:** Experience designing and implementing file system architectures, including journaling and caching techniques.
- **Device Drivers:** Skilled in writing and debugging device drivers for various hardware components.
- **Bootloaders & System Initialization:** Knowledgeable in boot process, firmware interaction, and system startup routines.
- **Security & Access Control:** Implementing security models, user permissions, and secure kernel modules.
- **Performance Optimization:** Profiling and tuning OS components for maximum efficiency and responsiveness.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Familiarity with multiple architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V) and cross-compilation toolchains.
- **Open Source Contribution:** Active contributor to OS-related open source projects, with a strong focus on collaborative development and code quality.
